Project Description:
  Our goal was to dig through data provided by Kaggle in order to determine factors that might cause more or less flight cancellations or delays. The long-term hope is that the research we do will prepare travelers with some applicable information that they can use to save themselves unwanted flight trouble. 
Data can be accessed through kaggle @ https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays

Questions:
Q1. Which airlines has the most cancellations and delay? 
Q2. Do all airlines follow similar delay and cancellation patterns throughout the year?
Q3. Which airlines are most susceptible to weather delay and cancellations and why?
Q4.Which region locations across America have the most delays and cancellations?
Q5. Does the distance of the flight matter for how likely a flight is to be cancelled or delayed?
Q6. What is the most common cancellation reason and why?
 
Summary of Results
Q1. 
American Eagle Airlines has the largest percentage of cancelled flights.
Spirit Air Lines has the largest percentage of delayed flights.
Both American Eagle and Spirit have the two worst combined percentage of cancelled and delayed flights.
Q2. 
Cancellation and Delay behavior changes from airline to airline over the year.
The majority of airlines largest percentage of flight cancellations happened in February.
The majority of airlines lowest percentage of flight cancellations happened between September and October.
The majority of airlines largest percentage of flight delays happened between June â€“ September
The majority of airlines lowest percentage of flight delays happened in April
Q3. 
Delta Air Lines and American Airlines were the most suseptible airlines to cancel due to weather.
Virgin America and Hawaiian Airlines were extreme outliers and rarely cancelled their flights due to weather
Q4. 
More cancellations happen out East then anywhere else in the United States 
-Delays are fairly consistent all throughout the United States
Q5. 
The shorter a flight is, the more likely it is for a flight to be cancelled. 
The longer a flight, the more likely the trip is to be delayed.
Q6.
Weather is the most frequent cancellation reason in our dataset and accounted for 54.4% of all cancelled flights.
The months between January and March experience the largest spike in flight cancellations across all cancellation reason.

Application:
     Readers can use this information to help making bad flight decisions that might increase their changes of a delay or cancellations (Ex, taking a short flight out East when there's a report of snow coming in). Hopefully using some of our results users will be able to classify when a flight might cause delays or cancellations for them in the future.
